Planning a successful animal tracking project requires careful consideration and clear objectives. It is crucial to plan ahead and understand how much data is required to accurately answer your chosen research questions, and choose the optimal tracking regime/schedule.\nTo assist with study design, movedesign integrates the continuous-time methods available with the ctmm package. Animal movement is inherently autocorrelated (locations are similar as a function of space and time) and the ctmm package allows us to model these data as continuous-time stochastic processes, while dealing with other known biases (such as small sample sizes, irregular or missing data, and location error).\nGo here for more information, including tutorials for single- and population-level inferences.\n\n\n\n\ninstall.packages(\"movedesign\")\n\nlibrary(movedesign)\nmovedesign::run_app()"

To achieve this, we calculate the semi-variance function (SVF), and visualize it through the variogram() function.\nRange residency: the tendency of an animal to remain within their home range.\nVariograms are an unbiased way to visualize autocorrelation structure, representing the average square displacement (y-axis) over a specific time lag (x-axis). To facilitate interpretation, we have the SVF of animal1_buffalo zoomed out (right) to showcase all time lags and (left) zoomed in to showcase time lags up to two months:\n\nlevel &lt;- 0.95 # we want to display 95% confidence intervals\nxlim &lt;- c(0,2 %#% \"month\") # to create a window of 2 months\n\nSVF &lt;- variogram(animal1_buffalo)\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(SVF, fraction = 1, level = level)\nabline(v = 1, col = \"red\", lty = 2) # adding a line at 1 month \nplot(SVF, xlim = xlim, level = level)\nabline(v = 1, col = \"red\", lty = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the variogram flattens (i.e., reaches an asymptote) after approximately 1 month ([red]{style=“color: red;”} line). This also indicates at how coarse the timeseries needs to be to assume independence (no autocorrelation), and corresponds to when traditional methods —such as minimum convex polygons (MCPs) and Kernel Density Estimators (KDEs)— could be applied without violating their assumptions."

We need to test what movement model may explain the autocorrelated structure of our tracking data. We can run different movement processes with maximum likelihood (ML) or other parameter estimators, such as perturbative Hybrid REML (pHREML). To facilitate further comparisons, we will run both ML and pHREML with the ctmm.select function.\n\n# Calculate an automated model guesstimate:\nGUESS1 &lt;- ctmm.guess(animal1_buffalo, interactive = FALSE)\n\n# Automated model selection, starting from GUESS:\nFIT1_ML &lt;- ctmm.select(animal1_buffalo, GUESS1, method = 'ML')\nFIT1_pHREML &lt;- ctmm.select(animal1_buffalo, GUESS1, method = 'pHREML')\n## reminder: it will default to pHREML if no method is specified.\n\nsummary(FIT1_ML)\nsummary(FIT1_pHREML)\n\nWithin these summaries, $name provides the selected best-fit model, $DOF provides information on the degrees of freedom (where $DOF[\"area\"] corresponds to the effective sample size of the home-range area estimate), and $CI are the parameter outputs (area, position autocorrelation timescale, velocity autocorrelation timescale, and speed).\nThe typical pool of candidate models includes isotropic (when diffusion is the same in every direction; symmetrical) and anisotropic (when diffusion varies with direction; asymmetrical) variants. The automated model selection shows that OUF anisotropic (anisotropic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck foraging process) is our best-fit model. This movement process features a home range, correlated positions, and correlated velocities. To check the full model selection table, we can run the following command:\n\nFIT1_pHREML_verbose &lt;- ctmm.select(animal1_buffalo, GUESS1, verbose = TRUE)\nsummary(FIT1_pHREML_verbose)\n\nBy adding the argument verbose = TRUE we have access to the model selection table. By default, model selection is based on Akaike’s Information Criterion adjusted for small sample sizes (AICc). The ctmm package also offers BIC, LOOCV, and HSCV. LOOCV seems to work slightly better for very small datasets, but we recommend AICc for the majority of datasets."

    "text": "Step 5. Evaluating additional biases, applying mitigation measures\n\n5.1. Buffalo tracking data\n\nsummary(UD1_pHREML)$DOF[\"area\"] # effective sample size of animal1\n\n    area \n15.65773 \n\nnrow(animal1_buffalo) # absolute sample size\n\n[1] 1725\n\n\nOur output here also reveals more information regarding our dataset: the effective sample size (N) and the absolute sample size (n). We can return this measure with the summary function: in our case, the N for animal1_buffalo is 15.7. Comparatively, our absolute sample size is easy to output, as it is the total number of observations within our dataset (n = 1,725).\nAbsolute sample size (n): the number of observations (fixes) in a dataset.\nAs mentioned earlier, animal1_buffalo had a device malfunction that led GPS fixes to shift from one fix per hour, to one fix every two hours. As such, this individual is particularly suited for a weighted AKDEc (or wAKDEc), so we can re-run the function with weights set to TRUE:\n\nUD1w_pHREML &lt;- akde(animal1_buffalo, FIT1_pHREML, weights = TRUE)\nsummary(UD1w_pHREML)$CI # home range area estimation (weighted)\n\nOur new home range area estimation for animal1_buffalo is 761 km2 (with 95% confidence intervals: 432–1,182 km2). We can now plot our home range estimate for animal1_buffalo:\n\n# Creating an extent that includes both UDs at the 95% CI level:\nEXT &lt;- extent(list(UD1_ML, UD1_pHREML, UD1w_pHREML), level = 0.95)\n\n# Plotting pHREML (with and without weights) side-by-side:\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(animal1_buffalo, UD = UD1_pHREML, ext = EXT)\ntitle(expression(\"pHREML AKDE\"[\"C\"]))\nplot(animal1_buffalo, UD = UD1w_pHREML, ext = EXT)\ntitle(expression(\"pHREML wAKDE\"[\"C\"]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor animal1_buffalo, the difference between model parameter estimators is not substantial; we only have a ~5.7% AKDE area underestimation by ML compared to pHREML. However, the data fits the spatial locations much better.\n\n( 1 - summary(UD1_ML)$CI[1,2] / summary(UD1w_pHREML)$CI[1,2] ) * 100\n\n[1] 5.737587\n\n\n5.2. Gazelle tracking data\nWe can also check the difference with animal2_gazelle’s tracking data, where the small effective sample size issue is clearer:\n\nGUESS2 &lt;- ctmm.guess(animal2_gazelle, interactive = FALSE)\n\nFIT2_ML &lt;- ctmm.select(animal2_gazelle, GUESS2, method = 'ML')\nFIT2_pHREML &lt;- ctmm.select(animal2_gazelle, GUESS2, method = 'pHREML')\n\nUD2_ML &lt;- akde(animal2_gazelle, FIT2_ML)\nUD2_pHREML &lt;- akde(animal2_gazelle, FIT2_pHREML)\n\nWith animal2_gazelle, we have a more substantial area underestimation by ML compared to pHREML (~15.2%). We can also see that our effective sample size is only 4.5, with an absolute sample size of 49 (N ≪ n).\n\n( 1 - summary(UD2_ML)$CI[1,2] / summary(UD2_pHREML)$CI[1,2] ) * 100\n\n[1] 15.16696\n\nsummary(UD2_pHREML)$DOF[\"area\"] # effective sample size\n\n    area \n4.528926 \n\nnrow(animal2_gazelle) # absolute sample size\n\n[1] 49\n\n\nAt this point, we have selected a movement process, fed it into a home range area estimation with different model parameter estimators, and corrected for irregular sampling rates. With small effective sample sizes, it is important to see if parametric bootstrapping may be worth it to further reduce our estimation error. In order to do so, we can check the expected order of bias from pHREML:\n\n# Expected order of pHREML bias:\n1/summary(FIT2_pHREML)$DOF['area']^2\n\n      area \n0.04875393 \n\n\nThe bias is currently 𝒪(5%) (“in the order of” 5%). As such, we will run parametric bootstrapping for animal2_gazelle. The relative error target is 1% by default (argument error = 0.01), but can be adjusted if necessary.\n\nstart_time &lt;- Sys.time() # start recording running time\nBOOT &lt;- ctmm.boot(animal2_gazelle, FIT2_pHREML, trace = 2)\n## note: this function incurs substantial computational cost, may take hours!\n( total_time &lt;- Sys.time() - start_time ) # output running time\n\nsummary(BOOT)\n1/summary(BOOT)$DOF['area']^3 # expected order of bias\n\nWe can see that the expected order of bias was reduced to 2.3%, which is comparable to the numerical error target of 1%. To reduce the numerical error further, we would need to change the default relative error target of ctmm.boot, but the computational cost would continue to increase, and the comparably large statistical bias (2%) would remain.\nNow we will calculate the AKDEc based on the estimated parameters, and plot the home range of animal2_gazelle. Because of small effective sample size, we set optimal weights to TRUE for improved statistical efficiency:\n\nUD2_bpHREML &lt;- akde(animal2_gazelle, BOOT, weights = TRUE)\nsummary(UD2_bpHREML)$CI\n\nFinally, we have calculated our home range for animal2_gazelle, with an estimated area of 13,274 square kilometers (with 95% confidence intervals: 3,231–30,280 km2). Our uncertainty with animal2_gazelle is substantially higher than with animal1_buffalo, as expected due to the small effective sample size.\n\n# Creating an extent that includes both UDs at the 95% CI level:\nEXT &lt;- extent(list(UD2_pHREML, UD2_bpHREML), level = 0.95)\n\n# Plotting pHREML and bootstrapped-pHREML side-by-side:\npar(mfrow = c(1,2))\nplot(animal2_gazelle, UD = UD2_pHREML, ext = EXT)\ntitle(expression(\"pHREML AKDE\"[\"C\"]))\nplot(animal2_gazelle, UD = UD2_bpHREML, ext = EXT)\ntitle(expression(\"Bootstrapped pHREML wAKDE\"[\"C\"]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results presented here were generated with R version 4.2.3, and ctmm version 1.1.1."

    "text": "Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) threaten both biodiversity and human safety worldwide. Despite empirical efforts to characterize the major determinants of WVC risk and optimize mitigation strategies, we still lack a theoretical framework linking traffic, landscape, and individual movement features to collision risk. Here, we introduce such a framework by leveraging recent advances in movement ecology and reaction-diffusion stochastic processes with partially absorbing boundaries. Focusing on range-resident terrestrial mammals – responsible for most fatal WVCs – we model interactions with a single linear road and derive exact expressions for key survival statistics, including mean collision time and road-induced lifespan reduction. These quantities are expressed in terms of measurable parameters, such as traffic intensity or road width, and movement parameters that can be robustly estimated from relocation data, such as home-range crossing times, home-range sizes, or distance between home-range center and road. Therefore, our work provides an effective theoretical framework integrating movement and road ecology, laying the foundation for data-driven, evidence-based strategies to mitigate WVCs and promote safer, more sustainable transportation networks."
